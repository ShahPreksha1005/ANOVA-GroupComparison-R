# ANOVA Group Comparison in R

This repository contains an analysis of variance (ANOVA) project aimed at understanding the statistical differences between four groups (a, b, c, and d) using R. The project includes data preparation, ANOVA testing, and multiple comparison methods for in-depth group comparison.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preparation**: Define vectors for each group and combine them into a single data frame.
- **ANOVA Test**: Perform ANOVA to analyze variance between groups and print summary results.
- **Visualization**: Use boxplots to visualize the distribution across groups.
- **Multiple Comparisons**:
  - **Pairwise t-tests** for detailed group comparisons.
  - **Tukey’s HSD** and **Scheffe’s Test** for statistically significant differences between group means.

## Requirements
- R
- DescTools package for Scheffe’s test

## Results
The project highlights differences across the groups, providing insights into group-level variance and statistically significant differences using multiple comparison tests.
